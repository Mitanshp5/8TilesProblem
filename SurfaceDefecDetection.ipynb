Larger models run slower but have higher accuracy, while smaller models run faster but have lower accuracy. I made a brief YouTube video that compares performance of different YOLO models on a Raspberry Pi 5 and a laptop with a RTX 4050 GPU, [check it out here to get a sense of their speed accuracy](https://youtu.be/_WKS4E9SmkA). If you aren't sure which model size to use, `yolo11s.pt` is a good starting point.\n",

The best amount of epochs to use depends on the size of the dataset and the model architecture. If your dataset has less than 200 images, a good starting point is 60 epochs. If your dataset has more than 200 images, a good starting point is 40 epochs.\n",
